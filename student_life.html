            <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan we understand that students come from all walks of life and not everyone has access to the same resources. We believe that it is every students right to have access to food and other basic necessities. </p>

            <p>Our goal is to share information to students about resources that are available to them. Resources vary and new ones are regularly being discovered and created, meaning that students may not always find what they are looking for. Rest assured, that this website will be updated on a regular basis. </p>

            <p>This work would not be possible without the leadership of <a href = "https://studentlife.umich.edu">Student Life</a> and with the support from academic units and campus partners. </p>
